# Project Title
 
Recipe Generator using Crew AI and Upstage API

## Short Description
An AI-powered recipe generator that creates recipes using only the provided ingredients, leveraging Crew AI and the Upstage API.

## Long Description
This project implements a recipe generation system using Crew AI and a custom LLM (Language Model) that interfaces with the Upstage API. The system takes a list of ingredients as input and generates a complete recipe, ensuring that all provided ingredients are used and no additional ingredients are introduced.

Key features:
1. Custom LLM class (UpstageCustomLLM) for interfacing with the Upstage API
2. Crew AI agent setup for recipe generation
3. Recipe validation to ensure all ingredients are used
4. Command-line interface for easy ingredient input

The system uses a Chef agent with a specific goal and backstory to create recipes. It includes a validation loop to regenerate recipes if all ingredients are not initially used, ensuring the final output meets the specified requirements.
